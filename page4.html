	<h1>COUNTRY #3: SWITZERLAND</h1>
	<p>Switzerland, what a crazy country! To be honest, I never imagined I'd visit this country; I always thought it was something far beyond my reach, but I don't regret going. Although it was very cold, every place felt like something out of a movie, and unlike other places, I never felt any chaos or danger around me.</p>

<p>PLACE: </p>

	<p>My favorite place (which, obviously, I also found on TikTok) was a small town called <span style="font-style: oblique;">Grindelwald,</span> which was full of little cabins and towering, snow-covered mountains. The photo you'll see below is of a place within this town called <span style="font-style: oblique;">The Cliff.</span> This was a mountain where people skied, or, like us, simply climbed up to admire the view and feel like we were on top of the world while freezing our butts off.</p>

	<p>FOOD: </p>
	<p> I remember that after coming down that mountain we were incredibly hungry, so instinctively I opened Google Maps to look for a good place to eat. However, everything was either an hour away or closed, so we decided it was best to leave. As we were driving, we saw a small house in the distance that looked like a restaurant. We went in, and the owner told us it was reserved for an event, but she would make an exception for us. She quickly set up a table for us and proceeded to cook the best <span style="font-style: oblique;">Cheese Fondue</span> I've ever had in my life. I don't know if it was the taste, the hunger we had, or the view from that place, but it was the perfect combination for pure happiness. </p>
