	<h1>COUNTRY #1: FRANCE</h1>
	<p>This was one of my favorite countries... Although it was very cold and you could say it bears a certain resemblance to New York (chaos, crowds, rats, haha), this country, specifically Paris, has an unparalleled magic.</p>
<p>PLACE: </p>

	<p>My favorite place, even though it's a bit cliché, was the 
  	<span style="font-style: oblique;">Eiffel Tower.</span> 
  	I think what I liked most wasn't the structure itself, but being able to see with 	my own eyes something I had dreamed of for years, something I had seen in thousands 	of movies for as long as I can remember.

	<p>FOOD: </p>
	<p> I admit it, I found this thanks to TikTok, and obviously we had to wait in 	line, but it was worth every second, its called <span style="font-style: 	oblique;">Entrecote.</span> First, the service was very, very fast. Second, the 	price was great, considering you could order as many fries and meat as you wanted. 
 	Third, and most importantly, the taste was INCREDIBLE! </p>
