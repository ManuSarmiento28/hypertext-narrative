	<h1>COUNTRY #4: BELGIUM</h1>
	<p>I have mixed feelings about this country. Although the places were very, very beautiful, the people were a bit rude, almost xenophobic. But oh well, I'll focus on the good things: the historical sites, the food, and above all, that for the first time in my life I was in a place where it snowed heavily for a long time while I was walking.</p>

<p>PLACE: </p>

	<p>My favorite place was this strange sculpture called the <span style="font-style: oblique;">Atomium,</span>. I don't know much about its history, but I am surer it's an iconic symbol of Belgium, specifically of Brussels. According to Google, "it represents a unit cell of an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times." What I liked most was its imposing size and how it looked covered in snow from a distance.</p>

	<p>FOOD: </p>
	<p> Yes, another recommendation from TikTok. We couldn't leave Belgium without trying their most iconic waffles. This place is called <span style="font-style: oblique;"> Maison Daddy </span> , and besides being located in a historic house in Brussels, the waffles were next level. I remember ordering every type of batter with every type of sauce and every type of fruit, but the classic combination of waffle + strawberry + chocolate is definitely still the winner. </p>
