	<h1>COUNTRY #4: MONACO</h1>
	<p>I know some say this shouldn't be considered an independent country but rather part of France, but for me, it definitely should be. Monaco, for me, was the epitome of purchasing power, luxury, and unique cars and houses. This country is like something out of a fantasy, where everyone wakes up on a Tuesday morning and drives a Ferrari to get a €20 juice, then goes to Gucci, leaves with five shopping bags, and shows off their new purchases on a yacht with family and friends.</p>

<p>PLACE: </p>

	<p>My favorite spot was this curve that's part of the <span style="font-style: oblique;">F1 circuit.</span> My family are huge racing fans, so when we went, we walked the entire circuit, but this has to be the most iconic part because of how challenging it is. Also, while we were there, we saw so many incredible cars (like the one in the photo), and it's just amazing to see it in person after watching it on television for years. It's also important to mention that even though it was December, the weather was perfect, neither too cold nor too hot.</p>

	<p>FOOD: </p>
	<p> That day we weren't sure where we could eat since everything was excessively expensive, but we remembered that if we drove for 30 minutes we would reach Italy. I know this section is about Monaco, but I'm going to include this meal here since the restaurant was right on the border between the two countries. This place was a small restaurant run by a couple, and we clearly had to try the Italian food. In my case, I ordered a classic pizza: <span style="font-style: oblique;">the Margherita,</span>  and honestly, I understand why they say Italian pizzas are the best. The crust and the natural flavors were out of this world. </p>
