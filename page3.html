	<h1>COUNTRY #2: SPAIN</h1>
	<p>Although I hate to admit it, I think this was one of my least favorite countries on the trip. The people are very friendly, and ultimately it's easier for me to communicate with them since they speak Spanish (my native language). I feel that although all of its cities and landscapes are very, very beautiful, it bears a certain resemblance to my country, Colombia, so I didn't find that element of surprise.</p>

<p>PLACE: </p>

	<p>My favorite place wasn't in the capital, but in Barcelona, ​​which, by the way, was my favorite city in this country because of its beachy vibe and the energy of the people. Getting back to the point, my favorite place was the <span style="font-style: oblique;">Sagrada Familia.</span> This building is IMPRESSIVE: its details, its size, its colors, everything.</p>

	<p>FOOD: </p>
	<p> I know there are many typical Spanish dishes, but my favorite, I have to say, was the <span style="font-style: oblique;">Churros</span>, specifically the ones served at the hotel where we stayed. Although it's something you can eat practically anywhere in the world, these had something different about them. I think it was the combination of the texture and the flavor of the super thick, dark chocolate they were served with. </p>
